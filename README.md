# Prob_Reo
This formalization of probabilistic Reo extension is based upon a specific library which axiomatizes the properties required on some abstract type U representing
the real interval [0, 1]. This library is developed as an independent contribution (Paulin-Mohring, 2007). The whole contribution is
available at https://www.lri.fr/~paulin/ALEA/.
